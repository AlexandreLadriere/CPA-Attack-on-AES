# CPA Attack on AES-128 (STM32F0)

Simple implementation of a CPA Attack on the AES-128 using Matlab. 

This project is the result of a lab I did during my training at the EMSE. The subject can be found in the file [missing file] (in french), and all the results/analysis are in the file [CHAIR_LADRIERE_TP.pdf] (also in french). The AES implementation (in C) is in the [DPA-STM32] folder. The [Programme comm STM32] folder contains a program that was used to communicate with the target. All the EM field traces retrieved and used for the CPA attack are in the [Supports analyse statistique] folder. The implementation of the CPA is in the [tp_script.m] file.
